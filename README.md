# Towns And Kings
A Minecraft plugin

## What is it?
This plugin is meant to be used in a simple survival server where you want to add some spice.
The idea is that you can build a town alone/with friends and build 'empty' buildings for the plugin.
These 'empty' buildings are buildings that are going to get assesed automatically.
Based of these assesments the buildings can automate things.

Per example: You have a building with 30 furnaces in you do a command where you specify it should be a smeltery
and the building where you are standing inside gets assesed. Based of the amount of work needed to build it.
Then you can build a storage room where you put iron ore and coal inside it. Then you queue the smeltery and it smelts it for you.

## Thats cool, can i use this?
No, the thing you read is the concept.

## I want to help?
